# In the Bessel Folder:
## Bessel_process_simulation
### The file Bessel_simulation_E_M has the code to simulate BES(d) with Reflexive Euler-Maruyama method.
### The file Bessel has an application to the Smoluchowski diffusion-limited capture problem with BES(3).
### The file Bes(3)_with_mean has the same problem, but it plots the R(T) curve with respect to hitting time.

# In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Folder:
## OU_process_simulation
### The file OU_Euler_Maruyama.py  has the code to simulate OU with Euler-Maruyama method.
### The file OU_Euler_Maruyama_convergence has the code to simulate OU and evaluate the convergence and error of the method. The code is not optimezed and takes a long time to run.
### The file Financial_problem_simulation has an application to the finantial diffusion problem comparing Coke and Pepsi to evaluate Assets, Spread and Portfolio with OU.
