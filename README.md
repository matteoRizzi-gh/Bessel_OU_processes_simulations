## In the Bessel Folder:
# Bessel_process_simulation
The file Bessel_simulation_E_M has the code to simulate BES(d) with Reflexive Euler-Maruyama method.
The file Bessel has an application to the Smoluchowski diffusion-limited capture problem with BES(3).
The file Bes(3)_with_mean has the same problem, but it plots the R(T) curve with respect to hitting time.
